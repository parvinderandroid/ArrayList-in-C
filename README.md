# Array List in C

This is a small library that will give you the power of Java's ArrayList in C.

# Installation

Just include `ArrayList.h` in your program and you're good to go.

# How to use

Creating and initialising a List is as simple as:

```C
List *a = initialise();
```

There is a very easy to read `Documentation.md` included in this repository.

The `Demo.c` file has a dedicated function to demonstrate the working of each function.
